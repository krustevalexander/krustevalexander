# Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer with 17 years of experience, and I’ve spent my career building custom software solutions that help small and medium-sized businesses thrive. I run my own development company, where we craft tech tailored to real-world needs.

## What’s on My Radar
- Exploring **AI agents** and **Web3 projects**
- New to open-source and excited to contribute
- Into vibe coding ⛱️

## Let’s Build Something Cool Together
- Got a wild AI or Web3 idea? Hit me up!
- Want to team up on an open-source project? I’m in the game!
- Catch me on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/Krustev_A) and say hi.

Excited to vibe with the community and ship some cool stuff. Thanks for swinging by! 🚀
